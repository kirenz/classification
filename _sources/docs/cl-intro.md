# Introduction

In supervised learning, we have a dataset consisting of both features and labels. The task is to construct an estimator (model) which is able to predict the label of an object given the set of features. 

Supervised learning is further broken down into two categories: classification and regression. In classification, the label is discrete, while in regression, the label is continuous.

:::{note}
Classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data.

Examples of classification problems include:

- Given an example, classify if it is spam or not.
- Given a handwritten character, classify it as one of the known characters.
- Given recent user behavior, classify as churn or not.
